# M1-K-Nearest-Neighbours

The objective is to perform various experiments on Waveform dataset using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and study its the behaviour.

The experiments performed are listed as below:
1. Tuning the best K of K-NN classifier
2. Analysis of the Bias-Variance trade-off
3. K-NN from scratch
4. Reduce the complexity using CNN, RNN
5. Generating Artificial Imbalancy
